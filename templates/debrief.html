            <h5>Thank you for taking part in this study. Please read the following information carefully.</h5>

            <h5>You have been misled about the nature of the experiment. Throughout, you were told you were playing with another participant. This was not the case; you have been completing this experiment on your own. Your decisions never impacted any other participant and any information presented to you about other participants was made up. The true aim of this study was to understand the evolution of altruistic and antisocial behaviour and how this is influenced by others.</h5>

            <h5><strong>If you do not want your data to be used</strong>, click <button type="button" class = "btn btn-link" onClick = "removeMe()">here</button> to return the HIT and have your data destroyed (<strong>you will not receive your completion payment</strong>).
            Otherwise, simply continue and complete the study to receive your payment and bonus.</h5>
