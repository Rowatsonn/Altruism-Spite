        <h3>During part 1, you will be playing a game <strong>indepdendently</strong> with a <strong>bot</strong>. Your task is to earn as many points as you can across 5 rounds. Each round, you will be given 10 points and then must decide how much of this to send to the bot (you will get to keep what you don't send).</h3>
